# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? Version control allows you to create branches within a master file to keep track of changes in a program. You can access past versions and go back to previous save points. It is a way of organizing a program using different versions that are reviewed and then merged into the main program. It is useful because it allows you to track errors in the code and access a previous version with no errors until the errors have been fixed. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one? a branch is a way to create a change outside of the main branch or program. Once a branch is reviewed, it can be merged into the main program branch.


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is a save point. A good commit message should explain all changes that were made and give a clear description to others on the project.


* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when there is a problem when you attempt to merge a branch into another branch. I haven't run into one yet, but from research my understanding is that it usually occurs when you have commits in one branch, that are not in the other branch and so you have to reconcile that before the merge can occur.
