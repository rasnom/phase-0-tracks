	<h1> WeizWild Hybrid Experiments </h1>
		<h2> Original Wild and WeizWild </h2>
			<p>
				The original Wild was a beer made using 2 Row Barley and wild caught yeasts floating around West Oakland in October of 2016. It was surprisingly fruity, slightly tangy, and definetly strange. Not quite good, but with compelling elements.
			</p>
			<p>
				The WeizWild was the much more tasty mixture of equal parts of the Wild and the previous batch of <a>kit Hefeweizen</a>. It was lighter and less strange with fruity tangy overtones.
