What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

I'd say their purpose is to allow for flexible but consistent metaphors. Call something a list and I have some idea what how it will behave, but there can still be lots of kinds of lists. I like lists, so I am going to pick that as the one that I find most useful.



What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

Spacial order? Top to bottom, left to right, unless there is formatting info that specifies otherwise. 

Temporal order? Not sure yet, seems complicated. Best understanding/guess is outside-in or breadth first



What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

I will create snippets once I have figured out the best way to easily save those kinds of customizations in my repo.



What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

The hardest part about this challenge was not knowing whether a question was supposed to be obvious or not. Open ended questions like "What purpose does the title tag accomplish?" can lead to either really quick basic answers for fall down pretty deep rabbit holes. It would be helpful if there was some easy way to tell whether the writer of the challenge intended a given question to be quick or a rabbit hole.
