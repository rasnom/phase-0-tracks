# Plan for challenge 9.3

## Overall Approach
The challenge is three time bounded portions, 10 minutes now for planning, 2 hours for learning about jquery, and 45 minutes to build a thing. I do not plan to strictly segment my work in that exact way.

First, let's find an example jquery project or tutorial that includes a project and get it working in a playing_around subfolder.

Then let's decide on a basic something to make.

Then research any specifics for the particular project that are non-obvious and not already covered.

Build a proof of concept.

Not really try to refine the proof of concept, but if there is extra time just spending it playing. 

## Coda
I think that both looking at a full complex project and through tutorials were both useful, and am not actually sure if the relative order is important.

It was important to recognize when I was getting tired and bored and it was time to stop or try a different approach.
