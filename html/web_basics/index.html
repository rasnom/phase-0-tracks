<h1>Bears in Space</h1>
	<p><em>Most people</em> don't know that there are <strong>BEARS in SPACE</strong></p>
	<h2>There are a few reasons a bear might venture to space</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>They may be hungry and searching for moon cheese</li>
		<li>They may be going to verfiy that Pluto is indeed a planet</li>
		<li>They may be seeking international fame</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>We asked a few bears what their top 3 space destinations would be, here are the answers</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Jupiter (because it looks cool)</li>
		<li>The moon</li>
		<li>Mars</li>
	</ol>
